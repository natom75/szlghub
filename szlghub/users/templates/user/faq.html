        <h1>Frequently asked question (FAQ)</h1>
        <p>Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya (Hungarian: Vitéz[1] nagybányai Horthy Miklós; Hungarian pronunciation: [ˈviteːz ˈnɒɟbaːɲɒi ˈhorti ˈmikloːʃ]; English: Nicholas Horthy;[2] German: Nikolaus Horthy Ritter von Nagybánya; 18 June 1868 – 9 February 1957) was a Hungarian admiral and statesman who served as the regent of the Kingdom of Hungary between the two World Wars and throughout most of World War II, from 1 March 1920 to 15 October 1944.

            Horthy started his career as a sub-lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1896 and attained the rank of rear-admiral in 1918. He saw action in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto and became commander-in-chief of the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the last year of the First World War; he was promoted to vice-admiral and commander of the Fleet when the previous admiral was dismissed from his post by Emperor-King Charles following mutinies. In 1919, following a series of revolutions and external interventions in Hungary from Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, Horthy returned to Budapest with the National Army and was subsequently invited to become regent of the kingdom by parliament. Horthy led a national conservative[3] government through the interwar period, banning the Hungarian Communist Party as well as the Arrow Cross Party, and pursuing an irredentist foreign policy in the face of the Treaty of Trianon. The former king, Charles, unsuccessfully attempted twice to return to Hungary until, in 1921, the Hungarian Government caved into Allied threats to renew hostilities. Charles was escorted out of Hungary into exile.
            
            In the late 1930s, Horthy's foreign policy led him into a reluctant alliance with Germany against the Soviet Union. With the begrudging support of Adolf Hitler, Hungary was able to redeem certain areas ceded to neighboring countries by the Treaty of Trianon. Under Horthy's leadership, Hungary gave support to Polish refugees in 1939 and participated in a supportive (as opposed to front-line) role in the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.
            
            Horthy's reluctance to contribute to the German war effort and the Holocaust in Hungary, as well as refusing to hand over more than 600,000 of the 825,000 Hungarian Jews to German authorities, coupled with several attempts to strike a secret deal with the Allies of World War II after it had become obvious that the Axis would lose the war, eventually led the Germans to invade and take control of the country in March 1944 in Operation Margarethe. In October 1944, Horthy announced that Hungary had declared an armistice with the Allies and withdrawn from the Axis. He was forced to resign, placed under arrest by the Germans, and taken to Bavaria. At the end of the war, he came under the custody of American troops.[4]
            
            After appearing as a witness at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials in 1948, Horthy settled and lived out his remaining years in exile in Portugal. His memoirs, Ein Leben für Ungarn (A Life for Hungary),[5] were first published in 1953. He is perceived as a controversial historical figure in contemporary Hungary.[6][7][8][9] </p>
